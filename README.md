# Introduction


I was tasked to make an assignment about making a car loan calculator that calculates car price, down payment the user have to pay each year, loan period that the user have to fulfill and interest rate given by the loaner and then make a JAVA code to find out how much monthly repayment of the user. Pseudocode and flow chart have been created so we can see the process of the coding more clearly. To analyse the process; car price, down payment, loan period and interest rate are required to be filled by the user. By using the data given by the user, the data would be processed and then the payment schedule can be shown. I learnt a lot about the coding and how-to as the assignment tests me about my understanding of the Java (loop, if statements, arrayâ€¦...) in coding and programming.
